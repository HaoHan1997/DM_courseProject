## Data mining cource experiment of NWPU

We implemented a simple Bayes and Knn classifier to do classification based on the data set provided 

Bayes provided two ways of prediction, one is using laplace correcting and the other is not

Knn algorithm can choose the value "k" manually

We encode the different attribute with integers and calculate distance with Euclid Distance
